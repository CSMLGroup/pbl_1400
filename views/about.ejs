                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                        <p>Introductory programming courses often struggle with student engagement and the perceived difficulty of fundamental concepts. Traditional lecture-based approaches can feel abstract and disconnected from real-world applications, leading to low motivation and high dropout rates.</p>

                        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                        <p><strong>Central Research Question:</strong> How can project-based learning, supported by AI tools, make introductory programming more enjoyable and effective for students?</p>
                        <p>We believe that by combining hands-on project work with intelligent AI support, we can create an engaging learning experience that emphasizes problem-solving and creativity over rote memorization.</p>
